# Early-Stopping-and-Regularization-Techniques-in-CNN-for-Overfitting
Stop overfitting in CNNs with early stopping &amp; regularization! Early stopping halts training when validation performance declines. Regularization adds constraints like L1/L2 penalties to simplify weights, or Dropout to randomly ignore neurons. These techniques force the network to learn robust, generalizable features.
